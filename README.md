# Vasco de data
A flask app designed for the exploration (fast retrieval and cleaning) of public data.

A special thanks to *Blazing DB* for the inspiration to start this

As of now, the data base is populated via a public data API drawing from the UN and World Bank data sources that extracts, standardizes, and stores public data. these procs are stored in Vasco/ETL. Check out the database schema itself in Models.py, and if you'd like to propose UI tweaks Vasco/Static and Vasco/Templates hold the front end files.

Check out the demo on heroku here - https://vasco-de-data.herokuapp.com/index
