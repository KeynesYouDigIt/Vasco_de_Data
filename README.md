# Vasco de data
A flask app designed for the exploration (fast retrieval and cleaning) of public data.

A special thanks to *Blazing DB* for the inspiration to start this

As of now, this is a public data API drawing from the UN and World Bank data sources that extracts, standardizes, and stores public data. You can work with this API in a command line interface by cloning the repo, installing the requirements to a virtual env, and running the get_data_CLI.py from the CLI and admin tools folder.

There is a flask front end that can be run which displays data availibility now, and will soon be set up as a GUI to work with said data. Stay tuned for a demo. More data sources to come as well.
