# Vasco de data
A flask app designed for the exploration (fast retrieval and cleaning) of public data.

A special thanks to *Blazing DB* for the inspiration to start this

As of now, this is a public data API drawing from the UN and World Bank data sources that extracts, standardizes, and stores public data. You can work with this API in a command line interface by cloning the repo, installing the requirements to a virtual env, and running the get_data_CLI.py from the CLI and admin tools folder.

Check out the demo on heroku here - https://vasco-de-data.herokuapp.com/index
