# Vasco de data
A flask app designed for the exploration (fast retrieval and cleaning) of public data.

A special thanks to *Blazing DB* for the inspiration to start this

As of now, this is a public data API drawing from the UN and World Bank data sources that extracts, standardizes, and stores public data.

There is a flask front end that can be run which displays data availibility now, and will soon be set up as a GUI to work with said data. More sources to come as well.
